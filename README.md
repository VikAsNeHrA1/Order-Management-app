# Order-Management-app
**This app provides a streamlined order management solution tailored for warehouse environments. Recognizing that small business owners often lack efficient order management tools and resort to platforms like WhatsApp for team and distributor communication, our app offers a user-friendly alternative.**

### Background
During a recent summer vacation, one of our team members collaborated with a warehouse owner and gained insight into the business operations. He observed that their primary method for tracking warehouse stock was through a WhatsApp group chat. Recognizing the inefficiency, he believed there's potential for a more streamlined system to manage orders and monitor inventory levels.

### Application
This application is an Express-based web server connected to a MongoDB database, specifically designed for managing orders within a warehouse setting. The application offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for orders in the database.

### Project Scope
The purpose of this project is to create a warehouse- and store-specific application that will streamline the ordering and stock-management processes. Currently, many warehouses employ traditional messaging services like WhatsApp or iMessages to place orders. This program aims to swap out this inefficiency for a better-planned and focused system.
