### Background
During a recent summer vacation, one of our team members collaborated with a warehouse owner and gained insight into the business operations. He observed that their primary method for tracking warehouse stock was through a WhatsApp group chat. Recognizing the inefficiency, he believed there's potential for a more streamlined system to manage orders and monitor inventory levels.

### Application
This application is an Express-based web server connected to a MongoDB database, specifically designed for managing orders within a warehouse setting. The application offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for orders in the database.

### Project Scope
This project aims to develop a tailored application for warehouses and stores, enhancing the efficiency of order placement and inventory management. Recognizing that many warehouses currently rely on conventional messaging platforms like WhatsApp or iMessages for order processing, our program seeks to replace these makeshift methods with a more cohesive and targeted system.
