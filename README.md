### Background
During a recent summer vacation, one of our team members collaborated with a warehouse owner and gained insight into the business operations. He observed that their primary method for tracking warehouse stock was through a WhatsApp group chat. Recognizing the inefficiency, he believed there's potential for a more streamlined system to manage orders and monitor inventory levels.

### Application
This application is an Express-based web server connected to a MongoDB database, specifically designed for managing orders within a warehouse setting. The application offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for orders in the database.
